FBLA Computer Game and Simulation Programming 2023
Game Title: Imposter

RUNNING
- To run the program, click on the "Master_Folder_NE_Game_LincolnEast_Reddy" folder, then click on the "dist" folder.
- Then, click on the file named "game_lincolneast_reddy_2023". It is an application (.exe).
- The folder "build" does not need to be opened, and should not be edited or moved by the user.
- The program was made using Python Tkinter.
- Please note that all data is lost once the application is closed.

NOTE: Please do not close a window until after a game (6 levels) is over and you have clicked the 'Enter' button.
Closing a window too early can cause data to be registered incorrectly.

USER INTERFACE INSTRUCTIONS
- Once you type your answer into the text box, click 'Guess!' (or click the return key) to move on to the next set of words.
- Once you have completed a game (6 levels) and click the 'Enter' button, you will be returned to the Title Screen.

RULES
- You will be presented with a set of 4 words. You need to guess the word that does NOT match.
- For example, in the set 'gas, coal, wind, oil', you would guess 'wind' because it doesn't fit.
- (This is because wind is a renewable energy source while the other energy sources are non-renewable)
- You need to type the word that you think doesn't match into the text box and click 'Guess!' (or click the return key).
- You need to type the word EXACTLY as displayed, including the displayed capitalization and any hyphens.

DIFFICULTY
- Each set of words has a difficulty level of either 1, 2, or 3. 1 is the most simple difficulty, and 3 is the hardest difficulty.
- If you guess the 'imposter' word correctly, you will receive the same number of points as the difficulty level.
- For example, if you guess the imposter word correctly for a word set of difficulty level 2, you receive 2 points.
- You do NOT lose points for incorrect guesses.

LEVELS
- Each game lasts for 6 levels. The further you progress, the harder the levels will be.
- Levels 1 and 2 use word sets with a difficulty level of 1. 
- Levels 3 and 4 use word sets with a difficulty level of 2. 
- Levels 5 and 6 use word sets with a difficulty level of 3.
- The word sets are chosen randomly according to difficulty level.
- Currently, there are enough pre-made word sets to experience 5 games where every word set is new.
- After 5 games, the word sets are randomly reused.
- All pre-made word sets were created by me.

AT THE END OF A GAME
- You will see the celebratory message 'Great Job!', 'Good Job!', or 'Better Luck Next Time!' depending on your performance.
- You can type in your name and date (e.g. 'Satoru 1/1/23') to be shown on the leaderboard.
- If you close the window instead of clicking 'Enter', your name and score will not be shown on the leaderboard.
- If no games have been played, this will be noted on the leaderboard.

LEVEL CREATOR OVERVIEW
- MULTIPLAYER FEATURE/ADVANCED RULE FEATURE: You can create your own levels! 
- You are encouraged to find a friend to play your custom levels!
- You must create 6 levels at a time, then click 'Add Words'. The 'Exit' button will NOT save the words you type in. 

CREATING CUSTOM LEVELS
- Type in the words you want shown in 'Word Set' and the answer in 'Answer Word'. 
- For example, 'gas, coal, wind, oil' would go in a 'Word Set' box and 'wind' would go in an 'Answer Word' box.
- Pay attention to the difficulty on the left - word sets with higher difficulties should be harder to guess.
- Feel free to type in the pre-made levels found in the code to get a feel for how the level creator works.
- A few of these pre-made levels are listed below:

PRE-MADE LEVELS
gas, coal, wind, oil --- wind
notebook, video, paper, textbook --- video
Earth, Sun, Mercury, Venus --- Sun
rose, daisy, sunflower, tree --- tree
key, vault, password, safe --- password
flute, trumpet, trombone, xylophone --- xylophone

PLAYING CUSTOM LEVELS
- Click 'Play Custom Levels' to play the levels you created!
- The custom levels will be generated randomly according to difficulty, not the exact order you entered them in.
- If no custom levels have been made, this will be noted if the user tries to play custom levels.
